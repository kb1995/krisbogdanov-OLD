  <h2>Rails Junior</h2>
  <p>A short announcement that I'm launching <a href="https://railsjunior.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">railsjunior.com</a></p>
  <p>Rails Junior is a blog that covers cool problems that I encounter in my job, as well as any development work from my side projects and freelancing.</p>
  <p>Even though it's called Rails Junior, I will cover Javascript, CSS and Git problems and tricks that are worth mentioning.</p>
  <p>In addition, there will be theory questions, which deepen my knowledge in Ruby as a language. This will hopefully help other people to prepare for technical interviews.</p>

  <h2>Why I'm creating this blog</h2>
  <p><b>Solidify my skills: </b> whenever I need to do something new, I do all the research and then I implement it. I might encounter the same problem months later and likely, I will need to do the same research all over again.</p>
  <p>Spending several hours writing for this certain problem will help me deepen my knowledge about the particular problem. When I encounter it again, I can just check out my article that I wrote about it.</p>

  <p><b>Salary reviews: </b>this blog is a list of some of the things that I have learnt over the last couple of months. It also illustrates that I have a passion to learn and get better.</p>
  <p>From talking to my manager, I learnt that one of the things that I should do in order to get a salary raise is to become a better developer (well, that's obvious). Being better at your jobs transitions to having more impact within my team and the company as a whole.</p>

  <p><b>Employability: </b>I believe that Rails Junior will make me more employable in addition to everything else that I'm doing.</p>
  <p>Technical managers love stuff that show passion outside of your regular work - side projects and blogs for example.</p>

  <p><b>Continue building my personal brand: </b>by focusing on SEO and writing articles, I will get a steady audience growth.</p>
  <p>Steady growth is all I want for Rails Junior. A developer has a certain problem - they google it and they land on my article, which gives them the answer they were looking for.</p>
  <p>Furthermore, I will include a newsletter option at the bottom of the articles, which eventually will help me build a community of passionate full-stack developers.</p>
