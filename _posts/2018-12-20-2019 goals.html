    <h2>2018 👋</h2>
    <p>I finished my placement year at <a href="https://www.icwg.com/" target="_blank">ICWG</a>. Developed some great Excel skills, which I am hoping to make into a product/service at some point in 2019.</p>
    <p>After months of 5am web dev learning sessions, I got a summer internship as a software developer at <a href="https://airbyte.uk/" target="_blank">Airbyte</a>. I now work there part-time alongside my final year at uni.</p>
    <p>I ran a marathon 🏃, even though my goal was to just run a half.</p>
    <p>Always exceed your goals, right?</p>

    <h2>The downside of New Year's resolutions and yearly goals</h2>
    <p>Having goals is great and all, but the thing is that one year is a very long length of time. </p>
    <p>Your knowledge will develop, your dreams will evolve, your environment will change. Therefore, most likely your goals will change as well.</p>
    <p>Focus on daily success, so you can achieve your weekly goals, so you can achieve your monthly goals.</p>
    <p>Do that and it won't matter if your long-term goals stay the same, evolve or completely get discarded - <b>you will still be in a good place to tackle new challenges</b>.</p>

    <h2>TL;DR 2019</h2>
    <p>This year will be about
    <ul>
      <li>becoming really good at coding</li>
      <li>making products</li>
      <li>doing more weights and cardio than I thought possible</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Grind on a daily basis and put the work in consistently and <b><u>2019 will be x10 bigger</u></b> than what you currently predict.</p>

    <h2>Run 100km in a day</h2>
    <p>In 2018, I ran a marathon. In 2019, I will run 100km across a trail in Vitosha Mountain, Bulgaria.</p>
    <p>Training already started.</p>

    <h2>Earn £100 from personal projects</h2>
    <p>We all need to start from somewhere - <b>2019 will be my start</b>.</p>
    <p>I want to prove to myself that I can earn cash from personal projects!</p>
    <p>But first, I need to make them - so better start shipping. 🛳️ </p>
