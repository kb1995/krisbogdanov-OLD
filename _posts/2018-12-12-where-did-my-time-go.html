  <h2>Idea and problem</h2>
  <p>I wake up between 5-6am every morning with the goal to have a productive 3-4 hours before I start my day. 🏃‍♀</p>
  <p>However, sometimes I have the feeling that I achieve nothing.</p>
  <p>In order to tackle this, I logged every activity I did on a notepad. When the morning was over, I looked back and inspected my activities.</p>
  <p>Good product to build to solve this.</p>

  <h2>Design & Build</h2>
  <h3>Design 🎨</h3>
  <p>I wanted a simple activity log and categorise my tasks as either <b>productive</b> or <b>unproductive</b>.</p>
  <p>Once done, I was going to have a timeline where I can inspect all activities in a cool, minimalist timeline.</p>
  <h3>Build 🏭</h3>
  <p>I built the product livestream on Twitch. This was a pretty cool experience - I never experienced so many people watching me code before. Must have been pretty boring for them.</p>
  <p>Where did my time go was built in <b>ReactJS</b>. I don't need any backend (I store information in localStorage).</p>
  <p>I'm also pretty fast and efficient with ReactJS, so why not.</p>

  <h2>Ship</h2>
  <p>As soon as the product hit MVP stage, I decided to stop working on it and share it on Twitter. <b>It took me about 5 hours of coding</b>.</p>
  <p>More features to come in the near future:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Ability to edit activities</li>
    <li>Drag and drop activities</li>
    <li>More statistics in the Timeline section, e.g. percentage of productive vs unproductive tasks; longest task.</li>
  </ul>
