  <h2>Failing to run 100km</h2>
  <div>
    <p>The most important thing I learnt from running is this: </p>
    <p class="text-center"><mark>Don't set goals you know you will achieve.</mark></p>
  </div>
  <p>I wouldn't have written this article if it wasn't for running. Before June 2018, I had never run more than 5km. When I completed my first ever 5km on the treadmill in the gym, I felt like I was going to collapse. </p>
  <p>However, I continued running 5km runs and by the autumn, I had the crazy idea to compete in the Vitosha 100 in June 2019. It's a 100 kilometers race in the Vitosha mountain in Bulgaria. It was even one of <a href="https://kris.ventures/blog/2019-goals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">my main yearly goals.</a></p>
  <p>So I started preparing. In October 2018, I did my first marathon, 3 months later my first 50k and straight after, the Reading half marathon.</p>

  <p>I am writing this article after Vitosha 100.</p>
  <p>I didn't run in it.</p>
  <p>I didn't feel prepared so I decided against it.</p>
  <p>Instead of feeling bad or ashamed about it, I decided to look at this experience from another perspective.</p>
  <p>If I didn't have this overly ambitious goal, I wouldn't have run the 50k, or the marathon, or the hundreds of kilometers in preparation for the race.</p>
  <p>I failed at my big, flashy goal, but I still achieved a lot more than if I didn't set myself this goal.</p>

  <h2>Crushing the half marathon</h2>
  <p>I signed up to run the Reading half marathon with my manager, Steve, in spring 2019.</p> 
  <p>I expected to run the race in 2 hours, which would have been a fantastic time for me. My personal record. There were different starting sections depending on how fast you wanted to run. Steve decided that we should join the 1:40 pacers.<mark>That was impossible in my mind.</mark></p>
  <p>Nontheless, I said "sure, let's do it", while imagining that I would run with them for 1km and then slow down and join the 2-hour racers.</p>
  <p>After the first 3 kilometers, I felt exhausted and had to stop. Steve went ahead because I had to walk for a bit in order to catch my breath. Fortunately, I regained my energy and was able to finish in <mark> 1:51 hours.</mark></p>
  <p>If I had started with the 2-hour runners, would I have gone above and beyond and finish in 1:51? <mark>No way.</mark></p>
  <img src="{% asset "goals-that-you-fail/image3.jpg" @path %}">
  <p>In my mind, 2 hours was the limit, so probably I would have finished even slower than this and still call it a success. But my limit was not 2 hours, it was 1:51. However, I didn't know this.</p>
  <p>I realised that I can achieve more than what I was capable when I put myself in a situation that was designed to fail. I couldn't have run in 1:40, but why not 1:50?</p>
</div>

<div>
  <h2>Goals designed for failure</h2>
  <p>The majority of times, we achieve less than what we have planned.</p>
  <p>Set yourself average goals, and you will achieve average or below average results. Set yourself impossible goals, and you will achieve above average results.</p>
  <img src="{% asset "goals-that-you-fail/image1.jpg" @path %}">
  <p><mark>I'm looking to consistently be above average.</mark></p>
  <p>Chances are that for a more ambitious goal, you will achieve a smaller percentage of the total goal. But probably it will still be more than the overall average goal.</p>
  <p>We will push ourselves more, whenever the goal is harder. Because we like a challenge, we don't want to know we can achieve something without a doubt. If we lose that competitive edge, we can get a bit... lazy.</p>
  <hr class="hr-w-50">
  <p>Going forward, I will set goals that I know I'm going to fail. I might not achieve it fully, but that's ok with me. It's much better to know that I have pushed myself as much as I can.</p>
